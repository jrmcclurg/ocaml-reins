  <h1>O'Caml Reins</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to the home page for the O'Caml Reins persistent data
  structure library.  This project began as an <a
  href="http://osp2007.janestcapital.com/">OCaml Summer Project</a>
  sponsored by Jane St. Capital and is now continuing on here at
  sourceforge.  Since it is my goal to include as many data structures
  as possible in this library, I am always looking for contributions
  from others.  Even if you don't have time to contribute code, but
  know of a data structure that you would like to see included, please
  let us know by sending a message to the <a
  href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/ocaml-reins-devel">mailing
  list</a>.  In addition to providing a large collection of data
  structures, the O'Caml Reins project also includes several features
  that I hope will make developing O'Caml applications easier such as
  a random testing framework and a collection of "standard" modules.
</p>
<h3>Current features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> List data types:
      <ul>
	<li> Single linked lists (compatible with the standard library type)</li>
	<li> O(1) catenable lists </li>
	<li> Acyclic double linked lists</li>
	<li> Random access lists with O(1) hd/cons/tl and O(log i)
	lookup/update for i'th element</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li> Double ended queues</li>
    <li> Sets/Maps:
      <ul>
	<li>AVL</li>
	<li>Red/Black</li>
	<li>Big-endian Patricia</li>
	<li>Splay</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li> Heaps:
      <ul>
	<li> Binomial </li>
	<li> Skew Binomial </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Zipper style cursor interfaces </li>
    <li> Persistent, bi-directional cursor based iterators (currently
    only for lists and sets)</li>
    <li> All standard types hoisted into the module level (Int, Bool, etc...)</li>
    <li> A collection of functor combinators to minimize boilerplate
    (e.g., constructing <tt>compare</tt> or <tt>to_string</tt>
    functions)</li>
    <li> Quickcheck testing framework
      <ul><li>Each structure provides a <tt>gen</tt> function that can
      generate a random instance of itself</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li> Completely safe code.  No -unsafe or references to Obj.*</li>
    <li> Consistent function signatures.  For instance, all <tt>fold</tt>
    functions take the accumulator in the same position.</li>
    <li> All operations use no more than O(log n) stack space (except
    for a few operations on splay trees which currently have O(log n)
    expected time, but O(n) worst case) </li>

  </ul>

<h3>Coming features</h3>
There are several features that were not quite ready for this release
  but are in the works:
  <ul>
    <li> Space and time asymptotic bounds on all functions </li>
    <li> Automatic benchmarking of all included data structures (based
    on Graeme Moss's PhD thesis)
      <ul><li>Including a set of <i>Oracle</i> data structures which
      recommend a specific implementation based on observed executions</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li> Fill in missing functionality.  For instance sets and maps
    need a {to,from}_list function and many list functions are still
    missing. </li>
    <li> More data structures:
      <ul>
	<li> weight balanced trees </li>
	<li> persistent arrays </li>
	<li> more heap implementations </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Iterators for maps and heaps </li>
    <li> 100% code coverage from the test suite</li>
    <li> Web based manual / tutorial for using some of the less
    intuitive features </li>
  </ul>
